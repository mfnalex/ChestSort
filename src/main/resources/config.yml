###############################
#######  Placeholders   #######
###############################

# When using PlaceholderAPI, you can use the following placeholders:

# %chestsort_sortingenabled%    - true if this player has automatic sorting enabled for containers
# %chestsort_invsortingenabled% - true if this player has automatic sorting enabled for the player's inventory


############################
##### Default settings #####
############################

# If you don't want to use a permission plugin, you can set
# this to false to allow every player to use ChestSort.
# If you use a permissions plugin, set this to true.
# There are two permissions used by ChestSort:
# - chestsort.use (allow chest sorting by hotkeys and via /chestsort)
# - chestsort.use.inventory (allow inventory sorting by hotkeys and via /invsort)
use-permissions: true

# when set to false, no player is allowed to enable automatic chest sorting
# hotkeys will still work if enabled
allow-automatic-sorting: true

# when set to false, no player is allowed to enable automatic inventory sorting
# hotkeys will still work if enabled
allow-automatic-inventory-sorting: true

# when set to false, new players will have to run /chestsort
# once to enable automatic chest sorting.
sorting-enabled-by-default: false

# when set to false, new players will have to run /invsort on
# once to enable automatic inventory sorting.
inv-sorting-enabled-by-default: false

# You can prevent players from using the /chestsort and /invsort commands by setting
# this to false.
allow-commands: true

# You can prevent players from using the GUI. When set to "false", /sort behaves like /sort toggle
allow-gui: true

# when set to true, players with sorting DISABLED will be
# shown a message on how to enable automatic chest sorting
# when they use a chest for the first time.
# consider setting this to true when you disable sorting by default.
# see also -> message-when-using-chest
show-message-when-using-chest: true

# when set to true, players with sorting ENABLED will be
# shown a message on how to disable automatic chest sorting
# when they use a chest for the first time.
# consider setting this to true when you enable sorting by default.
# see also -> message-when-using-chest2
show-message-when-using-chest-and-sorting-is-enabled: false

# when set to true, the messages are shown again when a player
# logs out and back in and then uses a chest again.
show-message-again-after-logout: true

# to sort by category, we need category files. ChestSort comes
# with a number of pregenerated category files, named
# 900-valuables.txt, 910-tools.txt, 920-combat.txt, ...
# If you wish to edit those, you can disable the generation of these
# files, because otherwise all your changes in the pregenerated
# files will be overwritten on each server startup.
# However, a much smarter option is to copy the default files
# and rename them to from 900... to 800... and edit those instead.
auto-generate-category-files: true

# you can choose when ChestSort should sort chests.
# The default option is to sort when an inventory is closed.
# This is useful, because the onInventoryClose event never gets fired
# when access to the chest is forbidden by another plugin, e.g. WorldGuard
# You can also sort whenenver a chest is opened. ChestSort will then check
# if the onInventoryOpenEvent gets cancelled. If it does get cancelled,
# ChestSort will not sort the chest. However, if a plugin uses the
# MONITOR event priority, ChestSort cannot detect this.
# If you have problems with unaccessible chests being sorted, set this
# option to "close". If you want, you can sort twice, however this is not
# very useful.
# If you don't know what to put here, just use the default "close"
# Available options: open, close, both
sort-time: close

# when set to true, show some verbose information on startup
verbose: true

###########################
##### Default Hotkeys #####
###########################

# Instead of automatic sorting, you can also use hotkeys (see below)
# when using an inventory to have it sorted immediately.
# You can disable this by setting this to false.
allow-sorting-hotkeys: true

# You can define which sorting hotkeys are enabled by default.
# Players can also enable/disable these shortcuts individually via /chestsort hotkeys
# Hotkeys that could interfere with Minecraft's normal behaviour (e.g.
# shift+left-click) only work on empty slots, so don't worry about them.
#
# IMPORTANT! I get this question asked every day on my Discord, so please read:
# SETTING A HOTKEY TO FALSE WILL NOT(!) DISABLE IT!
# This are only the default values used for NEW players.
# Every player can disable/enable the hotkeys individually using
# /chestsort hotkeys
#
sorting-hotkeys:
  # Use middle click (mousewheel) on ANY inventory slot as hotkey. Permission: chestsort.hotkey.middleclick
  middle-click: true 
  # Use shift + left-click on any EMPTY inventory slot as hotkey. Permission: chestsort.hotkey.shiftclick
  shift-click: true
  # Use double left-click on any EMPTY inventory slot as hotkey. Permission: chestsort.hotkey.doubleclick
  double-click: true 
  # Use shift + right-click on any EMPTY inventory slot as hotkey. Permission: chestsort.hotkey.shiftrightclick
  shift-right-click: true

# Amount in seconds that players have to wait between using hotkeys to prevent them from spamming the
# sorting mechanism
hotkey-cooldown: 0.2

# When enabled, players can leftclick on chests, barrels etc.
# to sort them without having to open them.
# Permission: chestsort.hotkey.outside
allow-left-click-to-sort: true

# When set to true, sorting a chest by left-clicking it is enabled by default
left-click-to-sort-enabled-by-default: false

# Additionally to sorting hotkeys, you can quickly unload your inventory into a chest and vice versa
# using left-click or right-click outside of a chest's inventory.
# A single click will only affect matching items (items that are already present in the other inventory)
# and a double click will try to store/take all items.
allow-additional-hotkeys: true

# You can define which additional hotkeys are enabled by default.
# Players can also enable/disable these shortcuts individually via /chestsort hotkeys
additional-hotkeys:
  # Use left-click outside inventory to quickly put matching items from your inventory (except hotbar)
  # into the chest. Use left-double-click to put everything except your hotbar into the chest.
  # Permission: chestsort.hotkey.leftclick
  left-click: false
  # Use right-click outside inventory to quickly take all matching items from the chest into your
  # inventory. Use right-double-click to take all items out of the chest.
  # Permission: chestsort.hotkey.leftclick
  right-click: false

##########################
##### Update Checker #####
##########################

# Checks for updates (asynchronously).
# When enabled, a message is printed in the console if a new
# version has been found, and OPs will be notified when they join the server 
# When set to true, check for updates on startup and every X hours (see "check-interval" below)
# When set to on-startup, only check on server startup
# When set to false, don't check for updates
check-for-updates: true

# When you set "check-for-updates" to true, you can define the amount
# of hours inbetween each update check.
check-interval: 4

#########################
#### Disabled Worlds ####
#########################

# You can disable automatic chest sorting for certain worlds. Each world's name has to
# be on a separate line, starting with a hyphen and followed by a space.
# You can also use the YAML array notation: [world1, world2, world3]

# Example:
#
# disabled-worlds:
# - world_nether
# - world_the_end

disabled-worlds:

##########################
#####  Plugin hooks  #####
##########################

# ChestSort can hook into other plugins to allow better sorting
# for items belonging to 3rd party plugins.
# You do NOT have to disable the hooks for plugins you don't have
# installed. ChestSort will automatically check if the plugins
# are installed.

##### CrackShot ##### -> https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/crackshot-guns.48301/
# When CrackShot is installed, all CrackShot weapons will be
# grouped together and sorted by their name
hook-crackshot: true

# You can define a custom name that will be used as prefix
# for all CrackShot weapon names.
# E.g. when you set this to "crackshot_weapon", an AK-47
# will be called "crackshot_weapon_AK-47"
hook-crackshot-prefix: "crackshot_weapon"

##### InventoryPages ##### -> https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/inventorypages.32432/
# When InventoryPages is installed, ChestSort will not sort
# the "Next Page" and "Prev Page" buttons. You should not
# disable this behaviour unless you know what you are doing!
hook-inventorypages: true

##### Minepacks ##### -> https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/minepacks-backpack-plugin-mc-1-7-1-15.19286/
# When Minepacks version 2.3.8+ is installed, ChestSort can detect your
# backpacks and sort them like a regular chest.
hook-minepacks: true

##### PlayerVaults and similar plugins #####
# When PlayerVaults or similar plugins are installed, ChestSort can sort your
# player vaults just like regular chests.
hook-playervaults: true

##### EnderContainers ##### -> https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/endercontainers.4750/
# When EnderContainers version 2.2.1+ is installed, ChestSort can detect your
# enderchests and sort them like regular chests.
hook-endercontainers: true

##### CrateReloaded #####
# Prevents the player from using hotkeys on a crate
hook-cratereloaded: true

##### GoldenCrates #####
# Prevents the player from using hotkeys on a crate
hook-goldencrates: true

##### HeadDatabase #####
# Prevents the player from using hotkeys on the HeadDatabase GUI
hook-headdatabase: true

##### Slimefun #####
# Some versions of Slimefun fail to prevent putting the backpack into itself
# when you do so immediately after ChestSort moved a backpack. You can
# prevent ChestSort from moving Slimefun backpacks until they fixed this.
dont-move-slimefun-backpacks: false

##### AdvancedChests #####
# When AdvancedChests is installed, ChestSort will not sort
# the buttons from the bottom row. You should not
# disable this behaviour unless you know what you are doing!
hook-advancedchests: true

##### Other backpack plugins #####
# ChestSort is able to detect backpacks from most backpack
# plugins like ShulkerPacks or Better Shulker Boxes.
# This detection is always enabled, you cannot turn it off.

##### Other GUI plugins #####
# ChestSort tries to detect if an inventory belongs to a
# 3rd party plugin's GUI and then prevents it from being sorted.
# If you encounter any problems, like a sortable GUI inventory,
# please open a new issue at Github:
# https://github.com/JEFF-Media-GbR/Spigot-ChestSort/issues
hook-generic: true

##### Plugins not using an InventoryHolder #####
# When you have a plugin that uses "null" as InventoryHolder for their
# GUIs, you can prevent those from being sorted. Please note that this
# will also disable sorting for certain other inventories, so only use
# it if it's the only possibility.
prevent-sorting-null-inventories: false

##### Protection Plugins #####
# ChestSort checks whether a player is allowed to interact with a block
# before attempting to sort a container when using the "outside"/"left-click-block"
# hotkey. This can result in messages from WorldGuard, CoreProtect, etc. being
# send to the player. To avoid this, set the following setting to true.
# This can however lead to some warnings from other plugins that do not
# properly check a Players' class before casting it to "CraftPlayer".
# Although this should NOT cause ANY problems, it's disabled by default.
mute-protection-plugins: false

##########################
##### Sorting Method #####
##########################

# Advanced: how to sort things! See below for examples.
# Only change this if you know what you are doing.
#
# Available variables:
# {category}          order stuff by category as defined in plugins/ChestSort/categories/<category>.txt
# {keepCategoryOrder} orders stuff in the same category according to their line numbers in the category file
# {itemsFirst}        put items before blocks
# {blocksFirst}       put blocks before items
# {tier}              orders by material type from best to worst (netherite, diamond, gold, iron, stone, wood, then all remaining items)
# {name}              returns the name (e.g. DIRT, GRASS_BLOCK, BIRCH_LOG, DIAMOND_SWORD, ...)
# {color}             returns the color, e.g. light_blue for wool. Empty if block/item is not dyeable
# {customName}        returns the display name if set (e.g. with an anvil)
# {lore}              returns the lore if set
#
# Warning: You must not use spaces and fields have to be separated by commas.
#
# Examples:
#   sort by name and color:
#     '{name},{color}'
#
#   sort by name and color, but put items before blocks:
#     '{itemsFirst},{name},{color}'
#
#   sort by name and color, but put blocks before items:
#     '{blocksFirst},{name},{color}'
#
#   sort by category, then put items before blocks and sort by name and color
#      '{category},{itemsFirst},{name},{color}'
#
#   sort by category, but keep exactly the same order as defined in each category file, then sort any undefined items by name and color
#      '{category},{keepCategoryOrder},{name},{color}
#
sorting-method: '{category},{itemsFirst},{name},{color},{customName}'
